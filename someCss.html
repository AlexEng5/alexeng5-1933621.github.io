            Cold Stone Creamery is an American ice cream parlor chain. Headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, the company is owned and operated by Kahala Brands.
            [1] The company's main product is premium ice cream made with approximately 12-14% butterfat,[2][3] made on location and customized for patrons
            at time of order. Cold Stone has also expanded its menu with other ice cream-related products, including: ice cream cakes, pies, cookie sandwiches,
            smoothies, shakes and iced or blended coffee drinks. Since 2008, the company has been co-branding its locations with other chains in an attempt to
            not only increase its presence outside the United States, but transform its business model from seasonal to year-round.

            Dunkin' Donuts LLC,[1] also known as Dunkin',[n 1] is an American multinational coffee and doughnut company, as well as a quick service restaurant.
            It was founded by William Rosenberg in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1950. The chain was acquired by Baskin-Robbins's holding company Allied Lyons in 1990;
            its acquisition of the Mister Donut chain and the conversion of that chain to Dunkin' Donuts facilitated the brand's growth in North America that year.
            Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins eventually became subsidiaries of Dunkin' Brands, headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts, in 2004, until being purchased by
            Inspire Brands on December 15, 2020. The chain began rebranding as a "beverage-led company", and was renamed Dunkin', in January 2019; while stores in
            the U.S. began using the new name, the rebranding will eventually be rolled out to all of its international stores.[6]
